# Optimization_NN-GA

This project solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for transportation route optimization using multiple heuristic and metaheuristic strategies on six Solomon benchmark coordinate instances (C101, C201, R101, R201, RC101, RC201). The workflow converts Solomon VRP files into TSP inputs by keeping only (x, y) coordinates, builds a 100×100 Euclidean distance matrix, and evaluates solutions by total tour distance (shortest Hamiltonian cycle) under standard TSP constraints. A Nearest Neighbor constructive heuristic is used to generate a fast feasible initial tour, which is then improved through standalone and hybrid approaches including Hill Climbing (swap-based mutation search), Simulated Annealing (reversed-route neighborhood with temperature schedule and probabilistic acceptance), and Genetic Algorithm (population-based search using selection, crossover, and mutation).  ￼

The implementation compares GA, NN, NN–Hill Climbing, NN–SA, and NN–GA with consistent experiment settings (HC with much larger iterations than the others) and reports both distance quality and runtime. The GA variant uses a random initial population, fitness by Euclidean distance, selection, crossover (order-based), and swap mutation; the hybrid NN–GA seeds the GA population from the NN tour and applies rank/elitism-driven generation updates with crossover and mutation to accelerate convergence toward lower distances. Across the tested instances, NN–GA achieves the best total distances, and convergence plots illustrate that NN–GA reaches strong solutions earlier than NN–SA (even though NN–GA may have higher runtime), supporting the conclusion that NN-based constructive initialization improves both exploration and exploitation in metaheuristic search.
